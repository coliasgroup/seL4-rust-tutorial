# seL4 Microkit

The [seL4 Microkit](https://github.com/seL4/microkit) is a framework for creating static systems based on seL4.
This part of the text assumes that the reader is familiar with the basics of the Microkit framework and API, or is using a companion resource to learn about the Microkit in parallel.
Here are three such resources:
- The instructor
- The [Mirokit manual](https://github.com/seL4/microkit/blob/main/docs/manual.md)
- The [Mirokit tutorial](https://trustworthy.systems/projects/microkit/tutorial/welcome.html)

This part also assumes that the reader has worked through chapters [2](../root-task/hello-world.html) and [6](../root-task/spawn-thread.html) of [Part I](../root-task/index.html).
